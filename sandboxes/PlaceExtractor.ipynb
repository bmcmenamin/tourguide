       "'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Austin\\'\\'\\' ( ,  ) is the [[List of capitals in the United States|capital]] of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Texas]], as well as the [[county seat|seat]] and most populous city of [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]], with portions extending into [[Hays County, Texas|Hays]] and [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson]] counties. Incorporated on December 27, 1839, it is the [[List of United States cities by population|10th most populous city]] in the United States, the [[List of cities in Texas by population|fourth most populous city]] in the state after [[Dallas]], [[San Antonio]] and [[Houston]], and the second most populous state capital city after [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], the capital of [[Arizona]]. It has been one of the fastest growing large cities in the United States since 2010.   [[Downtown Austin]] and [[Downtown San Antonio]] are approximately 80. mi apart, and both fall along the [[Interstate 35]] corridor. This combined metropolitan region of [[San Antonio–Austin metroplex|San Antonio–Austin]] has approximately 5 million people. Austin is the southernmost state capital in the [[contiguous United States]] and is considered a [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network#Beta|Beta-level]] [[global city]] as categorized by the [[Globalization and World Cities Research Network]]. \\n\\nAs of 2021, Austin had an estimated population of 964,177, up from 961,855 at the [[2020 United States census|2020 census]]. The city is the cultural and economic center of the Austin–Round Rock metropolitan statistical area, which had an estimated population of 2,421,115 as of July 1, 2022. Located in Central Texas within the greater [[Texas Hill Country]], it is home to numerous lakes, rivers, and waterways, including [[Lady Bird Lake]] and [[Lake Travis]] on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], [[Barton Springs Pool|Barton Springs]], [[McKinney Falls State Park|McKinney Falls]], and [[Lake Walter E. Long]].\\n\\nResidents of Austin are known as [[List of people from Austin, Texas|Austinites]]. They include a diverse mix of government employees, college students, musicians, high-tech workers, and [[blue-collar worker]]s. The city\\'s official slogan promotes Austin as \"The Live Music Capital of the World\", a reference to the city\\'s many musicians and live music venues, as well as the long-running [[PBS]] TV concert series \\'\\'[[Austin City Limits]]\\'\\'. Austin is the site of [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW), an annual conglomeration of parallel [[Film festival|film]], [[interactive media]], and [[music festival]]s. The city also adopted \"[[Silicon Hills]]\" as a nickname in the 1990s due to a rapid influx of technology and development companies. In recent years, some Austinites have adopted the unofficial slogan \"[[Keep Austin Weird]]\", which refers to the desire to protect small, unique, and local businesses from being overrun by large corporations. Since the late 19th century, Austin has also been known as the \"[[City of the Violet Crown]]\", because of the colorful glow of light across the hills just after sunset. \\n\\nEmerging from a strong economic focus on government and education, since the 1990s, Austin has become a center for technology and business. The technology roots in Austin can be traced back to the 1960s when the defense electronics contractor Tracor (now BAE Systems) began operation in the city in 1962. IBM followed in 1967, opening a facility to produce its Selectric typewriters. Texas Instruments set up in Austin two years later, Motorola (now NXP Semiconductors) started semiconductor chip manufacturing in 1974. A number of [[Fortune 500]] companies have headquarters or regional offices in Austin, including [[3M]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|Advanced Micro Devices (AMD)]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Meta Platforms|Facebook (Meta)]], [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[NXP Semiconductors]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Tesla, Inc.|Tesla]], [[Texas Instruments]], and [[Whole Foods Market]]. With regard to education, Austin is the home of the [[University of Texas at Austin]], one of the largest universities in the U.S., with over 50,000 students. In 2021, Austin became home to the [[Austin FC]], the first (and currently only) [[Major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada|major professional sports team]] in the city.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAustin, Travis County and Williamson County have been the site of human habitation since at least 9200 BC. The area\\'s earliest known inhabitants lived during the late [[Pleistocene]] (Ice Age) and are linked to the [[Clovis culture]] around 9200 BC (over 11,200 years ago), based on evidence found throughout the area and documented at the much-studied [[Gault (archaeological site)|Gault Site]], midway between [[Georgetown, Texas|Georgetown]] and [[Fort Cavazos]]. \\n\\nWhen settlers arrived from Europe, the [[Tonkawa]] tribe inhabited the area. The [[Comanche]]s and [[Lipan Apache people|Lipan Apaches]] were also known to travel through the area. Spanish colonists, including the [[Isidro de Espinosa|Espinosa]]-[[Antonio de Olivares|Olivares]]-[[Pedro de Aguirre|Aguirre]] expedition, traveled through the area, though few permanent settlements were created for some time. In 1730, three [[Catholic missions]] from [[East Texas]] were combined and reestablished as one mission on the south side of the Colorado River, in what is now [[Zilker Park]], in Austin. The mission was in this area for only about seven months, and then was moved to [[San Antonio de Béxar]] and split into three missions. \\n\\nDuring the 1830s, pioneers began to settle the area in central Austin along the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. Spanish forts were established in what are now [[Bastrop, Texas|Bastrop]] and [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]].  Following [[History of Mexico#Independence era (1808–1829)|Mexico\\'s independence]], new settlements were established in [[Central Texas]].  \\n\\n[[File:Texas capitol goddess 1888.jpg|thumb|Statue of the Goddess of Liberty on the [[Texas State Capitol]] grounds, prior to installation atop the rotunda|alt=|left|215x215px]]\\n\\nIn 1835–1836, Texans fought and won [[Texas Revolution|independence from Mexico]]. Texas thus became an independent country with its own president, congress, and monetary system. In 1839, the Texas Congress formed a commission to seek a site for a new capital of the [[Republic of Texas]] to replace [[Houston]]. When he was Vice President of Texas, [[Mirabeau B. Lamar]] had visited the area during a [[American bison|buffalo]]-hunting expedition between 1837 and 1838. He advised the commissioners to consider the area on the north bank of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] (near the present-day [[Congress Avenue Bridge]]), noting the area\\'s hills, waterways, and pleasant surroundings. It was seen as a convenient crossroads for trade routes between [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]] and [[Galveston Bay]], as well as routes between northern Mexico and the [[Red River of the South|Red River]]. In 1839, the site was chosen, and was briefly incorporated under the name \"Waterloo\". Shortly afterward, the name was changed to Austin in honor of [[Stephen F. Austin]], the \"Father of Texas\" and the republic\\'s first secretary of state.\\n\\nThe city grew throughout the 19th century and became a center for government and education with the construction of the [[Texas State Capitol]] and the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. \\n\\n[[File:Austin old capital.png|thumb|Second capitol building in Austin|left]]\\n\\n[[Edwin Waller]] was picked by Lamar to survey the village and draft a plan laying out the new capital. The original site was narrowed to 640 acres that fronted the Colorado River between two creeks, Shoal Creek and [[Waller Creek]], which was later named in his honor. Waller and a team of surveyors developed Austin\\'s first [[city plan]], commonly known as the [[Waller Plan]], dividing the site into a 14-block grid plan bisected by a broad north–south thoroughfare, Congress Avenue, running up from the river to Capital Square, where the new Texas State Capitol was to be constructed. A temporary one-story capitol was erected on the corner of Colorado and 8th Streets. On August 1, 1839, the first auction of 217 out of 306 lots total was held. The Waller Plan designed and surveyed now forms the basis of downtown Austin.\\n\\nIn 1840, a series of conflicts between the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]] and the [[Comanche]]s, known as the [[Council House Fight]] and the [[Battle of Plum Creek]], pushed the Comanches westward, mostly ending conflicts in Central Texas. Settlement in the area began to expand quickly. Travis County was established in 1840, and the surrounding counties were mostly established within the next two decades. \\n\\nInitially, the new capital thrived but Lamar\\'s political enemy, [[Sam Houston]], used two Mexican army incursions to [[San Antonio]] as an excuse to move the government. Sam Houston fought bitterly against Lamar\\'s decision to establish the capital in such a remote wilderness. The men and women who traveled mainly from Houston to conduct government business were intensely disappointed as well. By 1840, the population had risen to 856, nearly half of whom fled Austin when Congress recessed. The resident [[African American]] population listed in January of this same year was 176. The fear of Austin\\'s proximity to the Indians and Mexico, which still considered Texas a part of their land, created an immense motive for Sam Houston, the first and third President of the Republic of Texas, to relocate the capital once again in 1841. Upon threats of Mexican troops in Texas, Houston raided the Land Office to transfer all official documents to Houston for safe keeping in what was later known as the [[Archive War]], but the people of Austin would not allow this unaccompanied decision to be executed. The documents stayed, but the capital would temporarily move from Austin to Houston to [[Washington-on-the-Brazos, Texas|Washington-on-the-Brazos]]. Without the governmental body, Austin\\'s population declined to a low of only a few hundred people throughout the early 1840s. The voting by the fourth President of the Republic, [[Anson Jones]], and Congress, who reconvened in Austin in 1845, settled the issue to keep Austin the seat of government, as well as annex the Republic of Texas into the United States.\\n\\nIn 1860, 38% of Travis County residents were [[slavery in the United States|slaves]]. In 1861, with the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], voters in Austin and other Central Texas communities voted against secession.  However, as the war progressed and fears of attack by [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] forces increased, Austin contributed hundreds of men to the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] forces. The African American population of Austin swelled dramatically after the enforcement of the [[Emancipation Proclamation]] in Texas by [[Union Army|Union]] General [[Gordon Granger]] at Galveston, in an event commemorated as [[Juneteenth]]. Black communities such as [[Wheatville, Austin|Wheatville]], Pleasant Hill, and Clarksville were established, with Clarksville being the oldest surviving freedomtown ‒ the original post-Civil War settlements founded by former African-American slaves ‒ west of the [[Mississippi River]]. In 1870, blacks made up 36.5% of Austin\\'s population. \\n\\n[[File:Old map-Austin-1873-sm.jpg|thumb|An 1873 illustration of Edwin Waller\\'s layout for Austin|alt=|210x210px|left]]The postwar period saw dramatic population and economic growth. The opening of the [[Houston and Texas Central Railway]] (H&TC) in 1871 turned Austin into the major trading center for the region, with the ability to transport both cotton and cattle. The [[Missouri–Kansas–Texas Railroad|Missouri, Kansas & Texas]] (MKT) line followed close behind. Austin was also the terminus of the southernmost leg of the [[Chisholm Trail]], and \"drovers\" pushed cattle north to the railroad. Cotton was one of the few crops produced locally for export, and a [[cotton gin]] engine was located downtown near the trains for \"ginning\" cotton of its seeds and turning the product into bales for shipment. However, as other new railroads were built through the region in the 1870s, Austin began to lose its primacy in trade to the surrounding communities. In addition, the areas east of Austin took over cattle and cotton production from Austin, especially in towns like [[Hutto, Texas|Hutto]] and [[Taylor, Texas|Taylor]] that sit over the [[Texas blackland prairies|blackland prairie]], with its deep, rich soils for producing cotton and hay.  \\n\\nIn September 1881, Austin public schools held their first classes. The same year, Tillotson Collegiate and Normal Institute (now part of [[Huston–Tillotson University]]) opened its doors. The [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]] held its first classes in 1883, although classes had been held in the original wooden state capitol for four years before. \\n\\nDuring the 1880s, Austin gained new prominence as the [[Texas State Capitol|state capitol building]] was completed in 1888 and claimed as the seventh largest building in the world. In the late 19th century, Austin expanded its city limits to more than three times its former area, and the first granite dam was built on the Colorado River to power a new street car line and the new \"[[Moonlight tower|moon towers]]\". The first dam washed away in a flood on April 7, 1900. \\n\\nIn the late 1920s and 1930s, Austin implemented the [[1928 Austin city plan]] through a series of civic development and beautification projects that created much of the city\\'s infrastructure and many of its parks. In addition, the state legislature established the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] (LCRA) that, along with the city of Austin, created the system of dams along the Colorado River to form the [[Texas Highland Lakes|Highland Lakes]]. These projects were enabled in large part because the [[Public Works Administration]] provided Austin with greater funding for municipal construction projects than other Texas cities. \\n\\nDuring the early twentieth century, a three-way system of social segregation emerged in Austin, with Anglos, African Americans and Mexicans being separated by custom or law in most aspects of life, including housing, health care, and education. Deed restrictions also played an important role in [[residential segregation in the United States|residential segregation]]. After 1935 most housing deeds prohibited African Americans (and sometimes other nonwhite groups) from using land. Combined with the system of segregated public services, racial segregation increased in Austin during the first half of the twentieth century, with African Americans and Mexicans experiencing high levels of discrimination and social marginalization. \\n\\nIn 1940, the destroyed granite dam on the Colorado River was finally replaced by a hollow concrete dam that formed Lake McDonald (now called [[Lake Austin]]) and which has withstood all floods since. In addition, the much larger Mansfield Dam was built by the LCRA upstream of Austin to form Lake Travis, a flood-control reservoir. \\n\\nIn the early 20th century, the [[Texas Oil Boom]] took hold, creating tremendous economic opportunities in Southeast Texas and North Texas. The growth generated by this boom largely passed by Austin at first, with the city slipping from fourth largest to tenth largest in Texas between 1880 and 1920. \\n\\nAfter a severe lull in economic growth from the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], Austin resumed its steady development. Following the mid-20th century, Austin became established as one of Texas\\' major metropolitan centers. In 1970, the U.S. Census Bureau reported Austin\\'s population as 14.5% Hispanic, 11.9% black, and 73.4% non-Hispanic white. In the late 20th century, Austin emerged as an important high tech center for [[semiconductor]]s and software. The [[University of Texas at Austin]] emerged as a major university. \\n\\nThe 1970s saw Austin\\'s emergence in the national music scene, with local artists such as [[Willie Nelson]], [[Asleep at the Wheel]], and [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] and iconic music venues such as the [[Armadillo World Headquarters]]. Over time, the long-running television program \\'\\'Austin City Limits\\'\\', its namesake Austin City Limits Festival, and the [[South by Southwest]] music festival solidified the city\\'s place in the music industry. \\n\\n\\n[[File:Austin by Sentinel-2, 2020-03-25.jpg|alt=|thumb|upright=1|right|Austin as seen from space, 2020]]\\nAustin, the southernmost state capital of the contiguous 48 states, is located in [[Central Texas]] on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]]. Austin is 146 mi northwest of [[Houston]], 182 mi south of [[Dallas]] and 74 mi northeast of [[San Antonio]]. \\n\\nAustin occupies a total area of 790.1 km2. Approximately 18.6 km2 of this area is water.  Austin is situated at the foot of the [[Balcones Escarpment]], on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]], with three artificial lakes within the city limits: [[Lady Bird Lake]] (formerly known as Town Lake), [[Lake Austin]] (both created by dams along the Colorado River), and [[Lake Walter E. Long]] that is partly used for cooling water for the Decker Power Plant. [[Mansfield Dam]] and the foot of [[Lake Travis]] are located within the city\\'s limits. Lady Bird Lake, Lake Austin, and Lake Travis are each on the Colorado River. \\n\\nThe elevation of Austin varies from 425 ft to approximately 1000 ft above sea level. Due to the fact it straddles the [[Balcones Fault]], much of the eastern part of the city is flat, with heavy clay and loam soils, whereas the western part and western suburbs consist of rolling hills on the edge of the [[Texas Hill Country]]. Because the hills to the west are primarily [[limestone]] rock with a thin covering of topsoil, portions of the city are frequently subjected to [[flash flood]]s from the runoff caused by thunderstorms.  To help control this runoff and to generate hydroelectric power, the [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] operates a series of dams that form the [[Texas Highland Lakes]]. The lakes also provide venues for boating, swimming, and other forms of recreation within several parks on the lake shores. \\n\\nAustin is located at the intersection of four major ecological regions, and is consequently a temperate-to-hot green oasis with a highly variable climate having some characteristics of the desert, the tropics, and a wetter climate.  The area is very diverse ecologically and biologically, and is home to a variety of animals and plants. Notably, the area is home to many types of wildflowers that blossom throughout the year but especially in the spring. This includes the popular [[bluebonnet (plant)|bluebonnets]], some planted by [[Lady Bird Johnson|\"Lady Bird\" Johnson]], wife of former President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. \\n\\nThe soils of Austin range from shallow, gravelly clay loams over limestone in the western outskirts to deep, fine sandy loams, silty clay loams, silty clays or clays in the city\\'s eastern part. Some of the clays have pronounced shrink-swell properties and are difficult to work under most moisture conditions. Many of Austin\\'s soils, especially the clay-rich types, are slightly to moderately alkaline and have free [[calcium carbonate]]. \\n\\n\\n\\n \\t\\n\\n\\nAustin\\'s skyline historically was modest, dominated by the Texas State Capitol and the University of Texas [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|Main Building]]. However, since the 2000s, many new high-rise towers have been constructed. Austin is currently undergoing a skyscraper boom, which includes recent construction on new office, hotel and residential buildings. Downtown\\'s buildings are somewhat spread out, partly due to a set of [[zoning]] restrictions that preserve the view of the [[Texas State Capitol]] from various locations around Austin, known as the [[Texas Capitol View Corridors|Capitol View Corridors]]. \\n[[File:9162018.Moon.Light.towers.NRSID76002071 02.jpg|thumb|upright|One of the 15 remaining [[Moonlight towers (Austin, Texas)|moonlight towers]] in Austin]]\\nAt night, parts of Austin are lit by \"artificial moonlight\" from [[moonlight tower]]s built to illuminate the central part of the city. The 165 ft moonlight towers were built in the late 19th century and are now recognized as historic landmarks. Only 15 of the 31 original innovative towers remain standing in Austin, but none remain in any of the other cities where they were installed. The towers are featured in the 1993 film \\'\\'[[Dazed and Confused (film)|Dazed and Confused]]\\'\\'.\\n\\nIn December 2023, amid rising home prices, the Austin City Council loosened the city\\'s zoning rules to permit by-right development of triplexes on each lot and loosened restrictions on tiny homes. \\n\\n\\nThe central business district of Austin is home to the tallest condo towers in the state, with [[The Independent (Austin, Texas)|The Independent]] (58 stories and 690 ft tall) and [[The Austonian]] (topping out at 56 floors and 685 ft tall). The Independent became the tallest all-residential building in the U.S. west of [[Chicago]] when topped out in 2018. In 2005, then-Mayor Will Wynn set out a goal of having 25,000 people living downtown by 2015. Although downtown\\'s growth did not meet this goal, downtown\\'s residential population did surge from an estimated 5,000 in 2005 to 12,000 in 2015. The skyline has drastically changed in recent years, and the residential real estate market has remained relatively strong. , there were 31 high rise projects either under construction, approved or planned to be completed in Austin\\'s downtown core between 2017 and 2020. Sixteen of those were set to rise above 400 ft tall, including four above 600\\', and eight above 500\\'. An additional 15 towers were slated to stand between 300\\' and 399\\' tall.\\n\\n\\n\\nAustin is located within the middle of a unique, narrow transitional zone between the dry deserts of the American Southwest and the lush, green, more humid regions of the American Southeast. Its climate, topography, and vegetation share characteristics of both. Officially, Austin has a [[humid subtropical climate]] (\\'\\'Cfa\\'\\') under the [[Köppen climate classification]]. This climate is typified by long, very hot summers, short, mild winters, and warm to hot spring and fall seasons in-between. Austin averages 34.32 in of annual rainfall distributed mostly evenly throughout the year, though spring and fall are the wettest seasons. Sunshine is common during all seasons, with 2,650 hours, or 60.3% of the possible total, of bright sunshine per year. \\n\\nSummers in Austin are very hot, with average July and August highs frequently reaching the high-90s (34–36 °C) or above. Highs reach 90 F on 123 days per year, of which 29 days reach 100 °F; all years in the 1991-2020 period recorded at least 1 day of the latter. The average daytime high is 70 F or warmer between March 1 and November 21, rising to 80 F or warmer between April 14 and October 24, and reaching 90 F or warmer between May 30 and September 18. The highest ever recorded temperature was 112 °F occurring on September 5, 2000, and August 28, 2011.  An uncommon characteristic of Austin\\'s climate is its highly variable humidity, which fluctuates frequently depending on the shifting patterns of air flow and wind direction. It is common for a lengthy series of warm, dry, low-humidity days to be occasionally interrupted by very warm and humid days, and vice versa. Humidity rises with winds from the east or southeast, when the air drifts inland from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], but decreases significantly with winds from the west or southwest, bringing air flowing from [[Chihuahuan Desert]] areas of [[West Texas]] or northern Mexico. \\n\\nWinters in Austin are mild, although occasional short-lived bursts of cold weather known as \"[[Texas Norther|Blue Norther]]s\" can occur. January is the coolest month with an average daytime high of 62.5 °F. The overnight low drops to or below freezing 12 times per year, and sinks below 45 °F during 76 evenings per year, mostly between mid-December and mid-February. The average first and last dates for a freeze are December 1 and February 15, giving Austin an average growing season of 288 days, and the coldest temperature of the year is normally about 24.2 °F under the 1991-2020 climate normals, putting Austin in USDA zone 9a. \\nConversely, winter months also produce warm days on a regular basis. On average, 10 days in January reach or exceed 70 F and 1 day reaches 80 F; during the 1991-2020 period, all Januarys had at least 1 day with a high of 70 F or more, and most (60%) had at least 1 day with a high of 80 F or more. The lowest ever recorded temperature in the city was -2 °F on January 31, 1949. Roughly every two years Austin experiences an [[ice storm]] that freezes roads over and cripples travel in the city for 24 to 48 hours. When Austin received 0.04 in of ice on January 24, 2014, there were 278 vehicular collisions. Similarly, snowfall is rare in Austin. A snow event of 0.9 in on February 4, 2011, caused more than 300 car crashes. The most recent major snow event occurred February 14–15, 2021, when 6.4 in of snow fell at Austin\\'s [[Camp Mabry]], the largest two-day snowfall since records began being kept in 1948.  \\n\\nTypical of [[Central Texas]], severe weather in Austin is a threat that can strike during any season. However, it is most common during the spring. According to most classifications, Austin lies within the extreme southern periphery of [[Tornado Alley]], although many sources place Austin outside of Tornado Alley altogether. Consequently, tornadoes strike Austin less frequently than areas farther to the north. However, severe weather and/or [[supercell|supercell thunderstorms]] can occur multiple times per year, bringing damaging winds, lightning, heavy rain, and occasional flash flooding to the city. The deadliest storm to ever strike city limits was the [[1922 Austin twin tornadoes|twin tornadoes storm]] of May 4, 1922, while the deadliest [[tornado outbreak]] to ever strike the metro area was the [[1997 Central Texas tornado outbreak|Central Texas tornado outbreak]] of May 27, 1997.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:2011 Texas Drought.jpg|thumb|The 2011 Texas drought dried up many of central Texas\\' waterways. This boat was left to sit in the middle of what is normally a branch of [[Lake Travis]], part of the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]].]]\\nFrom October 2010 through September 2011, both major reporting stations in Austin, Camp Mabry and Bergstrom Int\\'l, had the least rainfall of a [[water year]] on record, receiving less than a third of normal precipitation. This was a result of [[La Niña]] conditions in the eastern Pacific Ocean where water was significantly cooler than normal. David Brown, a regional official with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, explained that \"these kinds of droughts will have effects that are even more extreme in the future, given a warming and drying regional climate.\" The drought, coupled with exceedingly high temperatures throughout the summer of 2011, caused many wildfires throughout Texas, including notably the [[Bastrop County Complex Fire]] in neighboring Bastrop, Texas.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn the fall of 2018, Austin and surrounding areas received heavy rainfall and [[flash flood]]ing following [[Hurricane Sergio (2018)|Hurricane Sergio]]. The [[Lower Colorado River Authority]] opened four [[floodgates]] of the [[Mansfield Dam]] after Lake Travis was recorded at 146% full at 704.3 ft. From October 22 to October 29, 2018, the City of Austin issued a mandatory citywide [[boil-water advisory]] after the [[Texas Highland Lakes|Highland Lakes]], home to the city\\'s main water supply, became overwhelmed by unprecedented amounts of silt, dirt, and debris that had washed in from the [[Llano River]]. Austin Water, the city\\'s water utility, has the capacity to process up to 300 million gallons of water per day; however, the elevated level of [[turbidity]] reduced output to only 105 million gallons per day. Since Austin residents consumed an average of 120 million gallons of water per day, the infrastructure was not able to keep up with demand. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Austin, Texas covered in snow ESA23166430.jpeg|thumb|Austin covered in snow on February 15, 2021. Photo from [[ESA]].]]\\nIn February 2021, [[Winter Storm Uri]] dropped prolific amounts of snow across Texas and Oklahoma, including Austin. The Austin area received a total of 6.4 in of snowfall between February 14 and 15, with snow cover persisting until February 20. \\nThis marked the longest time the area had had more than 1 in of snow, with the previous longest time being three days in [[1985 North American cold wave|January 1985]]. \\n\\nLack of [[winterization]] in [[Gas-fired power plant|natural gas power plants]], which supply a large amount of power to the [[Texas Interconnection|Texas grid]], and increased energy demand caused [[ERCOT]] and [[Austin Energy]] to enact [[rolling blackouts]] in order to avoid total grid collapse between February 15 and February 18. Initial rolling blackouts were to last for a maximum of 40 minutes, however lack of energy production caused many blackouts to last for much longer, at the peak of the blackouts an estimated 40% of Austin Energy homes were without power. \\n\\nStarting on February 15, Austin Water received reports of pipe breaks, hourly water demand increased from 150 million gallons per day (MGD) on February 15 to a peak hourly demand of 260 MGD on February 16. On the morning of February 17 demand increased to 330 MGD, the resulting drop of water pressure caused the Austin area to enter into a [[boil-water advisory]] which would last until water pressure was restored on February 23. \\n\\n\\n\\nBeginning January 30, 2023 the City of Austin experienced a winter freeze which left 170,000 Austin Energy customers without electricity or heat for several days. The slow pace of repairs and lack of public information from City officials frustrated many residents. A week after the freeze and when Austin City Council members were proposing to evaluate his employment, City Manager Spencer Cronk finally apologized. On Thursday February 16, 2023, Cronk was fired by the Austin City Council for the city\\'s response to the winter storm. Former City Manager Jesus Garcia was named Interim City Manager. \\n\\n\\nThe Austin Parks and Recreation Department received the Excellence in Aquatics award in 1999 and the Gold Medal Awards in 2004 from the [[National Recreation and Park Association]].  \\n\\nTo strengthen the region\\'s parks system, which spans more than 29000 acres, The Austin Parks Foundation (APF) was established in 1992 to develop and improve parks in and around Austin. APF works to fill the city\\'s park funding gap by leveraging volunteers, philanthropists, park advocates, and strategic collaborations to develop, maintain and enhance Austin\\'s parks, trails and green spaces.\\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:ButlerTrailAustin.jpg|thumb|Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail along [[Lady Bird Lake]]]]\\n[[File:BartonCreek-2010-c.JPG|thumb|Sculpture Falls along the [[Barton Creek Greenbelt]]]]\\n[[File:DeepEddyPoolBySteveHopson.jpg|thumb|Austin\\'s [[Deep Eddy Pool]] is the oldest human-made pool in Texas.]]\\n[[File:Hamilton Pool March 2016 3.JPG|thumb|[[Hamilton Pool Preserve]]|alt=]]\\n[[File:Covert Park at Mount Bonnell 20160905130602.jpg|thumb|View of the Colorado River from Covert Park at [[Mount Bonnell]]|alt=]]\\n\\n[[Lady Bird Lake]] (formerly Town Lake) is a river-like reservoir on the Colorado River. The lake is a popular recreational area for [[Paddleboarding|paddleboards]], [[kayak]]s, [[canoe]]s, [[dragon boat]]s, and [[rowing (sport)|rowing shell]]s. Austin\\'s warm climate and the river\\'s calm waters, nearly 6 mi length and straight courses are especially popular with [[sport rowing|crew]] teams and clubs. Other recreational attractions along the shores of the lake include swimming in [[Deep Eddy Pool]], the oldest swimming pool in Texas, and Red Bud Isle, a small island formed by the 1900 [[Austin Dam failure (Texas)|collapse of the McDonald Dam]] that serves as a recreation area with a dog park and access to the lake for canoeing and fishing. The 10.1 mi Ann and Roy Butler Hike and Bike Trail forms a complete circuit around the lake. A local nonprofit, The Trail Foundation, is the Trail\\'s private steward and has built amenities and infrastructure including trailheads, lakefront gathering areas, restrooms, exercise equipment, as well as doing Trailwide [[ecological restoration]] work on an ongoing basis. The Butler Trail loop was completed in 2014 with the public-private partnership 1-mile Boardwalk project. \\n\\nAlong the shores of Lady Bird Lake is the 350 acre [[Zilker Park]], which contains large open lawns, sports fields, cross country courses, historical markers, concession stands, and picnic areas. Zilker Park is also home to numerous attractions, including the [[Zilker Botanical Garden]], the [[Umlauf Sculpture Garden]], Zilker Hillside Theater, the Austin Nature & Science Center, and the Zilker Zephyr, a  gauge [[Ridable miniature railway|miniature railway]] carries passengers on a tour around the park.  [[Auditorium Shores]], an [[urban park]] along the lake, is home to the [[Palmer Auditorium]], the [[Long Center for the Performing Arts]], and an [[Dog park|off-leash dog park]] on the water. Both Zilker Park and Auditorium Shores have a direct view of the Downtown skyline. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe [[Barton Creek Greenbelt]] is a 7.25 mi public [[green belt]] managed by the City of Austin\\'s Park and Recreation Department. The Greenbelt, which begins at [[Zilker Park]] and stretches South/Southwest to the Woods of Westlake [[subdivision (land)|subdivision]], is characterized by large [[limestone]] cliffs, dense foliage, and shallow bodies of water. Popular activities include [[rock climbing]], mountain biking, and hiking. Some well known naturally forming swimming holes along Austin\\'s greenbelt include Twin Falls, Sculpture Falls, Gus Fruh Pool, and Campbell\\'s Hole. During years of heavy rainfall, the water level of the creek rises high enough to allow [[human swimming|swimming]], [[High diving|cliff diving]], [[kayaking]], [[Paddleboarding|paddle boarding]], and [[tubing (recreation)|tubing]].\\n\\n\\n\\nAustin is home to more than 50 public pools and [[swimming hole]]s. These include [[Deep Eddy Pool]], Texas\\' oldest human-made swimming pool, and [[Barton Springs Pool]], the nation\\'s largest natural swimming pool in an urban area.  Barton Springs Pool is spring-fed while Deep Eddy is well-fed. Both range in temperature from about 68.0 °F during the winter to about 71.6 °F during the summer.   [[Hippie Hollow Park]], a county park situated along Lake Travis, is the only officially sanctioned [[nude beach|clothing-optional public park]] in Texas. [[Hamilton Pool Preserve]] is a natural pool that was created when the dome of an underground river collapsed due to massive erosion thousands of years ago. The pool, located about 23 mi west of Austin, is a popular summer swimming spot for visitors and residents. Hamilton Pool Preserve consists of 232 acre of protected natural habitat featuring a jade green pool into which a 50 ft waterfall flows. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn May 2021, voters in the City of Austin reinstated a public camping ban. That includes downtown green spaces as well as trails and greenbelts such as along Barton Creek.\\n\\n[[McKinney Falls State Park]] is a [[state park]] administered by the [[Texas Parks and Wildlife Department]], located at the confluence of [[Onion Creek (Texas)|Onion Creek]] and Williamson Creek. The park includes several designated hiking trails and [[campground|campsites]] with water and electric. The namesake features of the park are the scenic upper and lower falls along Onion Creek. The [[Emma Long Metropolitan Park]] is a municipal park along the shores of [[Lake Austin]], originally constructed by the [[Civilian Conservation Corps]]. The 284 acre [[Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center]] is a [[botanical garden]] and [[arboretum]] that features more than 800 species of native Texas plants in both garden and natural settings; the Wildflower Center is located 10 mi southwest of Downtown in [[Circle C Ranch]]. Roy G. Guerrero Park is located along the Colorado River in [[East Riverside-Oltorf, Austin, Texas|East Riverside]] and contains miles of wooded trails, a sandy beach along the river, and a [[disc golf]] course.\\n\\nCovert Park, located on the top of [[Mount Bonnell]], is a popular tourist destination overlooking Lake Austin and the Colorado River. The mount provides a vista for viewing the city of Austin, Lake Austin, and the surrounding hills. It was designated a [[Recorded Texas Historic Landmark]] in 1969, bearing Marker number 6473, and was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 2015.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn 2020, there were 961,855 people, up from the [[2000 United States Census|2000 United States census]] tabulation where there were 656,562 people, 265,649 households, and 141,590 families residing in the city.

Austin\\'s non-Hispanic white population first dropped below 50% in 2005.   \\n\\n\\nAccording to a survey completed in 2014 by [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]], it is estimated that 5.3% of residents in the [[Greater Austin|Austin metropolitan area]] identify as [[LGBT|lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender]]. The Austin metropolitan area had the third-highest rate in the nation. \\n\\n\\nAccording to [[Sperling\\'s BestPlaces]], 52.4% of Austin\\'s population are religious. The majority of Austinites identified themselves as [[Christianity|Christians]], about 25.2% of whom claimed affiliation with the [[Catholic Church]]. The city\\'s Catholic population is served by the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Austin]], headquartered at the [[Cathedral of Saint Mary (Austin, Texas)|Cathedral of Saint Mary]]. Nationwide, 23% of Americans identified as Catholic in 2016. Other significant Christian groups in Austin include [[Baptists]] (8.7%), followed by [[Methodism|Methodists]] (4.3%), [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Latter-day Saints]] (1.5%), [[Anglicanism|Episcopalians or Anglicans]] (1.0%), [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] (0.8%), [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterians]] (0.6%), [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]] (0.3%), and other Christians such as the [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)|Disciples of Christ]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] (7.1%).

Of those, 1,169 were sheltered and 1,086 were unsheltered. In September 2019, the Austin City Council approved $62.7 million for programs aimed at homelessness, which includes housing displacement prevention, crisis mitigation, and [[affordable housing]]; the city council also earmarked $500,000 for crisis services and encampment cleanups. \\n\\nIn June 2019, following \\'\\'[[Martin v. Boise]]\\'\\', a federal court ruling on homelessness sleeping in public, the Austin City Council lifted a 25-year-old ban on camping, sitting, or lying down in public unless doing so causes an obstruction. The resolution also included the approval of a new housing-focused shelter in South Austin. In early October 2019, Texas Governor [[Greg Abbott]] sent a letter to Mayor Steve Adler threatening to deploy state resources to combat the camping ban repeal. On October 17, 2019, the City Council revised the camping ordinance, which imposed increased restrictions on sidewalk camping. In November 2019, the State of Texas opened a temporary homeless encampment on a former vehicle storage yard owned by the [[Texas Department of Transportation]]. \\n\\nIn May 2021, the camping ban was reinstated after a [[referendum|ballot proposition]] was approved by 57% of voters. The ban introduces penalties for camping, sitting, or lying down on a public sidewalk or sleeping outdoors in or near Downtown Austin or the area around the University of Texas campus. The ordinance also prohibits solicitation at certain locations. \\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Biking in Congress Avenue.JPG|alt=|thumb|Downtown Austin from Congress Avenue Bridge, with Texas State Capitol in background, 2012]]\\nThe [[Greater Austin]] [[metropolitan statistical area]] had a gross domestic product (GDP) of $86 billion in 2010. Austin is considered to be a major center for [[high tech]]. Thousands of graduates each year from the engineering and computer science programs at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] provide a steady source of employees that help to fuel Austin\\'s technology and defense industry sectors. As a result of the high concentration of high-tech companies in the region, Austin was strongly affected by the [[Dot-com bubble|dot-com boom]] in the late 1990s and subsequent bust. Austin\\'s largest employers include the [[Austin Independent School District]], the City of Austin, [[Dell]], the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Federal Government]], [[NXP Semiconductors]], [[IBM]], St. David\\'s Healthcare Partnership, Seton Family of Hospitals, the [[Texas|State of Texas]], the [[Texas State University]], and the University of Texas at Austin. \\n\\nOther high-tech companies with operations in Austin include [[3M]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Amazon (company)|Amazon]], [[Advanced Micro Devices|AMD]], Apartment Ratings, [[Applied Materials]], [[Arm (company)|Arm]], [[Bigcommerce]], [[BioWare]], [[Blizzard Entertainment]], [[Buffalo Technology]], [[Cirrus Logic]], [[Cisco Systems]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[eBay]], [[Electronic Arts]], [[Flextronics]], [[Facebook]], [[Google]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Hoover\\'s]], [[HomeAway]], [[HostGator]], [[Intel Corporation]], [[National Instruments]], [[Nintendo]], [[Nvidia]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[PayPal]], [[Polycom]], [[Qualcomm, Inc.|Qualcomm]], [[Rackspace]], [[RetailMeNot, Inc.|RetailMeNot]], [[Rooster Teeth]], [[Samsung|Samsung Group]], [[Silicon Labs]], [[Spansion]], [[United Devices]], [[VMware]], [[Xerox]], and [[Zoho Corporation]].

[[Austin Executive Airport]], along with several smaller airports outside the city center, serves general aviation traffic.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Texas Eagle arriving in Austin, en route from Los Angeles to Chicago.jpg|thumb|right|Amtrak\\'s \\'\\'Texas Eagle\\'\\' stops in Austin twice daily.]]\\n\\n[[Amtrak]]\\'s [[Austin (Amtrak station)|Austin station]] is located in west downtown and is served by the \\'\\'[[Texas Eagle]]\\'\\' which runs daily between Chicago and San Antonio, continuing on to Los Angeles several times a week. \\n\\nRailway segments between Austin and San Antonio have been evaluated for a proposed regional passenger rail project called \"Lone Star Rail\". However, failure to come to an agreement with the track\\'s current owner, [[Union Pacific Railroad]], ended the project in 2016. \\n\\n[[Greyhound Lines]] operates the current Austin Bus Station at the Eastside Bus Plaza  Grupo Senda\\'s Turimex Internacional service operates bus service from Austin to Nuevo Laredo and on to many destinations in Mexico from their station in East Austin. [[Megabus (North America)|Megabus]] offers daily service to San Antonio, Dallas/Fort Worth and Houston. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Austin Metrorail.jpg|thumb|[[Capital MetroRail]] train at [[Downtown station (Capital MetroRail)|Downtown Station]]]]\\n\\nThe [[Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (Capital Metro) provides public transportation to the city, primarily with its [[Capital MetroBus|MetroBus]] local bus service, the [[Capital MetroBus#MetroExpress|MetroExpress]] express bus system, as well as a [[bus rapid transit]] service, [[Capital MetroRapid|MetroRapid]]. Capital Metro opened a 32 mi [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system, [[Capital MetroRail]], in 2010. The system consists of a single line serving downtown Austin, the neighborhoods of East Austin, [[North Central Austin]], and Northwest Austin plus the suburb of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]].\\n\\nSince it began operations in 1985, Capital Metro has proposed adding [[light rail]] services to its network. Despite support from the City Council, voters rejected light rail proposals in 2000 and 2014. However, in 2020, voters approved Capital Metro\\'s US$10 billion transit expansion plan, [[Project Connect]], by a comfortable margin. The plan proposes 2 new light rail lines, an additional bus rapid transit line (which could be converted to light rail in the future), a second commuter rail line, several new MetroRapid lines, more MetroExpress routes, and a number of other infrastructure, technology and service expansion projects. \\n\\n[[Capital Area Rural Transportation System]] connects Austin with outlying suburbs and surrounding rural areas.\\n\\n\\n\\nAustin is served by several [[Ridesharing company|ride-sharing]] companies including [[Uber]] and [[Lyft]].   On May 9, 2016, Uber and Lyft voluntarily ceased operations in Austin in response to a city ordinance that required ride sharing company drivers to get fingerprint checks, have their vehicles labeled, and not pick up or drop off in certain city lanes.  Uber and Lyft resumed service in the summer of 2017. The city was previously served by [[Fasten (company)|Fasten]] until they ceased all operations in the city in March 2018. \\n\\nAustin is also served by Electric Cab of North America\\'s six-passenger [[electric car|electric cabs]] that operate on a flexible route from the [[Kramer station|Kramer MetroRail Station]] to [[The Domain (Austin, Texas)|Domain Northside]] and from the [[Downtown station (Capital MetroRail)|Downtown MetroRail station]] and MetroRapid stops to locations between the [[Austin Convention Center]] and near Sixth and Bowie streets by [[Whole Foods]]. \\n\\n[[Carsharing]] service [[Zipcar]] operates in Austin and, until 2019, the city was also served by [[Car2Go]] which kept its North American headquarters in the city even after pulling out. \\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|The Pfluger Pedestrian Bridge over the Colorado River]]\\n\\nThe city\\'s bike advocacy organization is Bike Austin. BikeTexas, a state-level advocacy organization, also has its main office in Austin. \\n\\n[[Bicycle]]s are a popular transportation choice among students, faculty, and staff at the University of Texas. According to a survey done at the University of Texas, 57% of commuters bike to campus. \\n\\nThe City of Austin and Capital Metro jointly own a [[bike-sharing]] service, [[Capital Metropolitan Transportation Authority#Other services|Capital MetroBike]], which is available in and around downtown. The service is a franchise of [[BCycle]], a national bike sharing network owned by [[Trek Bicycle]], and is operated by local nonprofit organization Bike Share of Austin. Until 2020 the service was known as Austin BCycle. In 2018, [[LimeBike|Lime]] began offering [[dockless bikes]], which do not need to be docked at a designated station. \\n\\nIn 2018, [[scooter-sharing system|scooter-sharing]] companies [[Lime (transportation company)|Lime]] and [[Bird (company)|Bird]] debuted [[Scooter-sharing system|rentable electric scooters]] in Austin. The city briefly banned the scooters — which began operations before the city could implement a permitting system — until the city completed development of their \"dockless mobility\" permitting process on May 1, 2018. Dockless electric scooters and bikes are banned from Austin city parks and the [[Lady Bird Lake#Ann and Roy Butler Hike-and-Bike Trail and Boardwalk|Ann and Roy Butler Trail and Boardwalk]]. For the 2018 [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], the city of Austin offered a designated parking area for dockless bikes and scooters. \\n\\n\\nAs of 2 November 2023, Austin (Texas) is the biggest city in the USA that abolished the requirement for parking minimum - for encouraging walking, biking, public transit, lowering the cost of housing and increase the amount of housing units that can be built in the city territory. [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and [[Minneapolis]] also took this action. \\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Museum weird 2012.jpg|thumb|Museum of the Weird on Sixth Street]]\\n[[File:Mexican American Cultural Center, Austin, TX IMG 6232.JPG|thumb|The Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center, located on Lady Bird Lake at 600 River Street]]\\n\\n\"Keep Austin Weird\" has been a local [[motto]] for years, featured on bumper stickers and T-shirts. This motto has not only been used in promoting Austin\\'s eccentricity and diversity, but is also meant to bolster support of local independent businesses. According to the 2010 book \\'\\'[[Weird City]]\\'\\' the phrase was begun by a local Austin Community College librarian, Red Wassenich, and his wife, Karen Pavelka, who were concerned about Austin\\'s \"rapid descent into commercialism and overdevelopment.\" The slogan has been interpreted many ways since its inception, but remains an important symbol for many Austinites who wish to voice concerns over rapid growth and development. Austin has a long history of vocal citizen resistance to development projects perceived to degrade the environment, or to threaten the natural and cultural landscapes. \\n\\nAccording to the [[Nielsen Company]], adults in Austin read and contribute to blogs more than those in any other U.S. metropolitan area. Austin residents have the highest Internet usage in all of Texas. In 2013, Austin was the most active city on [[Reddit]], having the largest number of views per capita. \\n\\n[[South Congress]] is a shopping district stretching down South Congress Avenue from Downtown. This area is home to coffee shops, eccentric stores, restaurants, food trucks, trailers, and festivals. It prides itself on \"Keeping Austin Weird,\" especially with development in the surrounding area(s). Many Austinites attribute its enduring popularity to the magnificent and unobstructed [[Texas Capitol View Corridors|view]] of the Texas State Capitol. \\n\\nThe [[Rainey Street Historic District]] is a neighborhood in Downtown Austin formerly consisting of [[bungalow]] style homes built in the early 20th century. Since the early 2010s, the former [[working class]] residential street has turned into a popular nightlife district. Much of the historic homes have been renovated into hotels, condominiums, bars and restaurants, many of which feature large porches and outdoor yards for patrons. The Rainey Street district is also home to the Emma S. Barrientos Mexican American Cultural Center.\\n\\nAustin has been part of the [[Creative Cities Network|UNESCO Creative Cities Network]] under [[Media arts|Media Arts]] the category. \\n\\n\\n[[File:Austin Texas Rent.webp|thumb|Austin, Texas average monthly rent]]\\n\"Old Austin\" is an [[adage]] often used by [[nostalgic]] natives. The term \"Old Austin\" refers to a time when the city was smaller and more [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] with a considerably lower cost of living and better known for its lack of traffic, [[Hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipsters]], and [[urban sprawl]]. It is often employed by longtime residents expressing displeasure at the rapidly changing culture, or when referencing nostalgia of Austin culture. \\n\\nThe growth and popularity of Austin can be seen by the expansive development taking place in its downtown landscape. This growth can have a negative impact on longtime small businesses that cannot keep up with the expenses associated with [[gentrification]] and the rising cost of real estate. A former Austin musician, [[Dale Watson (singer)|Dale Watson]], described his move away from Austin, \"I just really feel the city has sold itself. Just because you\\'re going to get $45 million for a company to come to town – if it\\'s not in the best interest of the town, I don\\'t think they should do it. This city was never about money. It was about quality of life.\" Though much is changing rapidly in Austin, businesses such as Thundercloud Subs are thought by many to maintain classic Austin business cultural sentiments unique to the history of the city; as Diana Burgess stated, \"I definitely appreciate that they haven\\'t raised their prices a ton or made things super fancy. I think it speaks to that original Old Austin vibe . A lot of us that grew up here really appreciate that.\" \\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Sixth Street (Austin) at night.jpg|thumb|[[Sixth Street (Austin, Texas)|Sixth Street]] on a weekend night]]\\n\\nThe [[William Sidney Porter House|O.

Sixth Street features annual festivals such as the [[Pecan Street Festival]] and Halloween night. The three-day [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] has been held in [[Zilker Park]] every year since 2002. Every year around the end of March and the beginning of April, Austin is home to \"Texas Relay Weekend.\"\\n\\nAustin\\'s Zilker Park Tree is a Christmas display made of lights strung from the top of a [[Moonlight tower]] in Zilker Park. The Zilker Tree is lit in December along with the \"Trail of Lights,\" an Austin Christmas tradition. The Trail of Lights was canceled four times, first starting in 2001 and 2002 due to the September 11 Attacks, and again in 2010 and 2011 due to budget shortfalls, but the trail was turned back on for the 2012 holiday season. \\n\\nFrom 1962 to 1998, the [[Austin Aqua Festival]], or \"Aqua Fest\", took place on the shores of Town Lake (now known as [[Lady Bird Lake]]). Originally conceived as a summer tourism draw, the multi-day event evolved from water-themed activities to a broader civic festival due to growth and community interest. Eventually attendance and financial solvency began to dwindle as larger music and summer festivals grew in prominence.\\n\\n\\n[[File:Two of many food trucks and trailers that serve the eclectic South Austin neighborhood of Austin, Texas LCCN2014632540.tif|thumb|A food truck trailer park in South Austin]]\\n\\nNotable Austin cuisine includes [[Texas barbecue]] and [[Tex-Mex]]; [[Franklin Barbecue]] in Austin\\'s has sold out of [[brisket]] every day since its establishment.  [[Breakfast taco]]s and [[Chili con queso|queso]] are popular food items in the city; Austin is sometimes called the \"home of the breakfast taco.\" [[Kolach (cake)|Kolach]]es are a common pastry in Austin bakeries due to the large [[Czech Americans|Czech]] and [[German Americans|German]] immigrant population in Texas. The [[Oasis Restaurant]] is the largest outdoor restaurant in Texas, which promotes itself as the \"Sunset Capital of Texas\" with its terraced views looking West over [[Lake Travis]]. P. Terry\\'s, an Austin-based fast food burger chain, has a loyal following among Austinites. Some other Austin-based chain restaurants include [[Amy\\'s Ice Creams]], [[Chuy\\'s]], [[DoubleDave\\'s Pizzaworks]], and [[Schlotzky\\'s]].\\n\\nAustin is also home to a large number of [[food trucks]], with 1,256 food trucks operating in 2016. The city of Austin has the second-largest number of food trucks per capita in the United States. Austin\\'s first [[food hall]], \"Fareground,\" features a number of Austin-based food vendors and a bar in the ground level and courtyard of [[One Congress Plaza]]. \\n\\nAustin has a large [[craft beer]] scene, with over 50 [[microbreweries]] in the metro area. Drinks publication VinePair named Austin as the \"top beer destination in the world\" in 2019. Notable Austin-area breweries include [[Jester King Brewery]], [[Live Oak Brewing Company]], and [[Real Ale Brewing Company]].\\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:ACL2009SBH.jpg|thumb|right|2009 [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]] with view of stages and Downtown Austin]]\\nAs Austin\\'s official slogan is \\'\\'The Live Music Capital of the World\\'\\', the city has a vibrant live [[Music of Austin|music scene]] with more music venues per capita than any other U.S. city. Austin\\'s music revolves around the many [[nightclub]]s on 6th Street and an annual music/film/[[interactive]] festival known as [[South by Southwest]] (SXSW). The concentration of restaurants, bars, and music venues in the city\\'s downtown core is a major contributor to Austin\\'s live music scene, as the ZIP Code encompassing the downtown entertainment district hosts the most bar or alcohol-serving establishments in the U.S. \\n\\nThe longest-running concert music program on American television, \\'\\'[[Austin City Limits]]\\'\\', is recorded at [[ACL Live at The Moody Theater]], located in the bottom floor of the 478 ft [[W Hotels]] in Austin.  \\'\\'Austin City Limits\\'\\' and [[C3 Presents]] produce the [[Austin City Limits Music Festival]], an annual music and art festival held at [[Zilker Park]] in Austin. Other music events include the Urban Music Festival, [[Fun Fun Fun Fest]], Chaos In Tejas and [[Old Settler\\'s Music Festival]]. [[Austin Lyric Opera]] performs multiple operas each year (including the 2007 opening of [[Philip Glass]]\\'s \\'\\'[[Waiting for the Barbarians (opera)|Waiting for the Barbarians]]\\'\\', written by University of Texas at Austin alumnus [[J. M. Coetzee]]). The [[Austin Symphony Orchestra]] performs a range of classical, pop and family performances and is led by music director and conductor [[Peter Bay]]. The Austin Baroque Orchestra and La Follia Austin Baroque ensembles both give historically informed performances of [[Baroque music]]. The [[Texas Early Music Project]] regularly performs music from the [[Medieval music|Medieval]] and [[Renaissance music|Renaissance]] eras, as well as the Baroque.\\n\\n\\nAustin hosts several film festivals, including the [[South by Southwest Film Conference|SXSW (South by Southwest) Film Festival]] and the [[Austin Film Festival]], which hosts international films. A [[movie theater]] chain by the name of [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema]] was founded in Austin in 1997; the South Lamar location of which is home to the annual week-long [[Fantastic Fest]] film festival. In 2004 the city was first in \\'\\'[[MovieMaker Magazine]]\\'s\\'\\' annual top ten cities to live and make movies. \\n\\nAustin has been the location for a number of motion pictures, partly due to the influence of The [[University of Texas at Austin College of Communication|University of Texas at Austin Department of Radio-Television-Film]].

Precourt negotiated an agreement with the City of Austin to build a $200 million privately funded stadium on public land at 10414 McKalla Place, following initial interest in Butler Shores Metropolitan Park and Roy G. Guerrero Colorado River Park. As part of an arrangement with the league, operational rights of Columbus Crew SC were sold in late 2018, and Austin FC was announced as Major League Soccer\\'s 27th franchise on January 15, 2019, with the expansion team starting play in 2021. \\n\\nThe [[Austin Country Club]] is a private golf club located along the shores of the Colorado River, right next to the [[Pennybacker Bridge]].

The council is accompanied by a hired [[city manager]] under the [[council-manager government|manager-council system of municipal governance]]. Council and mayoral elections are non-partisan, with a runoff in case there is no majority winner. A referendum approved by voters on November 6, 2012, changed the council composition from six council members plus a mayor elected at large to the current \"10+1\" district system. Supporters maintained that the at-large system would increase participation for all areas of the city, especially for those which had lacked representation from City Council. \\n\\nNovember 2014 marked the first election under the new system. The [[Federal government of the United States|Federal government]] had forced San Antonio and Dallas to abandon at-large systems before 1987; however, the court could not show a racist pattern in Austin and upheld the city\\'s at-large system during a 1984 lawsuit. In five elections between 1973 and 1994 Austin voters rejected single-member districts. \\n\\nAustin formerly operated its city hall at 128 West 8th Street. Antoine Predock and Cotera Kolar Negrete & Reed Architects designed a new city hall building, which was intended to reflect what \\'\\'[[The Dallas Morning News]]\\'\\' referred to as a \"crazy-quilt vitality, that embraces everything from country music to environmental protests and high-tech swagger.\" The new city hall, built from recycled materials, has solar panels in its garage. The city hall, at 301 West Second Street, opened in November 2004. [[Kirk Watson]] is the current mayor of Austin, assuming the office for a second non-consecutive term on January 6, 2023.\\n\\nIn the 2012 elections, City Council elections were moved from May to November and City council members were given staggered term limits In 2022 Proposition D moved the term of the Austin Mayor to coincide with Presidential election years, so [[Kirk Watson]] would only serve two years unlike his predecessor [[Steve Adler (politician)|Steve Adler]] \\n\\nLaw enforcement in Austin is provided by the [[Austin Police Department]], except for state government buildings, which are patrolled by the [[Texas Department of Public Safety]]. The University of Texas Police operate from the [[University of Texas at Austin|University of Texas]].\\n\\nFire protection within the city limits is provided by the [[Austin Fire Department]], while the surrounding county is divided into twelve geographical areas known as emergency services districts, which are covered by separate regional fire departments. Emergency medical services are provided for the whole county by Austin-Travis County Emergency Medical Services.  \\n\\n\\'\\'\\'Mayor [[Kirk Watson]] ([[Democratic Party (U.S.)|D]])\\'\\'\\'\\n\\nIn 2003, the city adopted a resolution against the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] that reaffirmed constitutionally guaranteed rights.\\n\\n\\nAs of 2019, Austin is one of the safest large cities in the United States. In 2019, the FBI named Austin the 11th safest city on a list of 22 American cities with a population above 400,000. \\n\\nFBI statistics show that overall violent and property crimes dropped in Austin in 2015, but increased in suburban areas of the city. One such southeastern suburb, [[Del Valle, Texas|Del Valle]], reported eight homicides within two months in 2016. According to 2016 [[Austin Police Department|APD]] crime statistics, the 78723 census tract had the most violent crime, with 6 murders, 25 rapes, and 81 robberies. The city had 39 homicides in 2016, the most since 1997.  \\n\\n\\nOne of the first American [[Mass shootings in the United States|mass]] [[school shooting]] incidents took place in Austin on August 1, 1966, when [[Charles Whitman]] shot 43 people, killing 13 from the top of the University of Texas tower. The [[University of Texas tower shooting]] led to the formation of the [[SWAT]] team of the [[Austin Police Department]].  \\n\\nIn 1991, [[1991 Austin yogurt shop murders|four teenage girls were murdered in a yogurt shop]] by an unknown assailant(s). A police officer responded to reports of a fire at the [[I Can\\'t Believe It\\'s Yogurt!]] store on Anderson Lane and discovered the girls\\' bodies in a back room. The murders remain unsolved. \\n\\nIn 2010, Andrew Joseph Stack III deliberately crashed his [[Piper PA-28 Cherokee]] into Echelon 1, a building in which the [[Internal Revenue Service]] was a lessee of, housing 190 employees. The resulting explosion killed one and injured 13 IRS employees, partially damaged the building and cost the IRS a total of $38.6 million. \\'\\'(see [[2010 Austin suicide attack]])\\'\\'\\n\\nA [[Austin serial bombings|series of bombings]] occurred in Austin in March 2018. Over the course of 20 days, five [[Letter bomb|package bomb]]s exploded, killing two people and injuring another five. The suspect, 23-year-old Mark Anthony Conditt of [[Pflugerville, Texas]], [[Suicide bombing|blew himself up]] inside his vehicle after he was pulled over by police on March 21, also injuring a police officer.  \\n\\nIn 2020, Austin was the victim of a [[cyberattack]] by the Russian group [[Berserk Bear]], possibly related to the [[2020 United States federal government data breach|U.S. federal government data breach]] earlier that year. \\n\\nOn April 18, 2021, a [[shooting]] occurred at the Arboretum Oaks Apartments near [[The Arboretum (Austin, Texas)|The Arboretum]] [[shopping center]], in which a former [[Travis County]] Sheriff\\'s Office [[detective]] killed his ex-wife, his adoptive daughter, and his daughter\\'s boyfriend. The suspect, who was previously charged with [[child sexual assault]], was arrested in [[Manor, Texas|Manor]] after a 20-hour manhunt.  \\n\\nA mass shooting took place in the early morning of June 12, 2021, on [[Sixth Street (Austin, Texas)|Sixth Street]], which resulted in 14 people injured and one dead. The man killed was believed to be an innocent bystander who was struck as he was standing outside a bar. A 19-year-old suspect was formally charged and arrested in [[Killeen, Texas|Killeen]] nearly two weeks after the shooting.   \\n\\nIn 2024, Zacharia Doar, a 23-year old Palestinian-American man, was attacked and stabbed in the chest on West 26th Street, [[West Campus, Austin, Texas|West Campus]], after returning rally in support of [[Israel–Hamas war|Palestinian Human rights]]. The assailant was arrested at the scene and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon.  \\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Federal Courthouse, Austin, TX IMG 6339.JPG|thumb|The 8-story U.S. Courthouse is located at Fourth, Fifth, San Antonio, and Nueces streets (opened December 2012). |alt=|220x220px]]\\nAustin is the [[county seat]] of [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] and hosts the [[Heman Marion Sweatt Travis County Courthouse]] downtown, as well as other county government offices. The [[Texas Department of Transportation]] operates the Austin District Office in Austin. The [[Texas Department of Criminal Justice]] (TDCJ) operates the Austin I and Austin II district parole offices in Austin. The [[United States Postal Service]] operates several post offices in Austin.\\n\\n\\n\\nFormer Governor [[Rick Perry]] had previously referred to it as a \"blueberry in the tomato soup\", meaning, Austin had previously been a Democratic city in a Republican state. However, Texas currently has multiple urban cities also voting Democratic and electing Democratic mayors in elections. \\n\\nAfter the most recent redistricting, Austin is currently divided between the [[Texas\\'s 10th congressional district|10th]], [[Texas\\'s 37th congressional district|37th]] and [[Texas\\'s 35th congressional district|35th Congressional districts]]. \\n\\n\\n\\nA controversial turning point in the political history of the Austin area was the [[2003 Texas redistricting]]. Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district–what was then the 10th District–for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7–2 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin\\'s districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]\\'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east. \\n\\n\\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the [[environmental movement]], which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy), and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life. Much of the environmental movement has matured into a debate on issues related to saving and creating an Austin \"sense of place.\" In 2012, Austin became just one of a few cities in [[Texas]] to ban the sale and use of plastic bags. However, the ban ended in 2018 due to a court ruling that regarded all bag bans in the state to contravene the Texas Solid Waste Disposal Act. In 2016, Austin became the first Gold designee of the [[SolSmart]] program, a national program from the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]] that recognizes local governments for enacting solar-friendly measures at the local level.  \\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to the 2015–2019 Census estimates, 51.7% of Austin residents aged 25 and over have earned at least a [[bachelor\\'s degree]], compared with the national figure of 32.1%. 19.4% hold a [[Graduate degree|graduate]] or [[professional degree]], compared with the national figure of 12.4%. \\n\\n\\n\\n[[File:Texas University at Austin (8095546843).jpg|alt=|thumb|[[University of Texas at Austin|The University of Texas at Austin]]]]\\n[[File:Austin Community College campus in 2013.jpg|thumb|[[Austin Community College District|Austin Community College]]]]\\n\\nAustin is home to the [[University of Texas at Austin]], the [[flagship institution]] of the [[University of Texas System]] with over 40,000 undergraduate students and 11,000 graduate students. \\n\\nOther institutions of higher learning in Austin include [[St. Edward\\'s University]], [[Huston–Tillotson University]], [[Austin Community College]], [[Concordia University Texas|Concordia University]], the [[Seminary of the Southwest]], [[Texas Health and Science University]], [[University of St. Augustine for Health Sciences]], [[Austin Graduate School of Theology]], [[Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary]], [[Virginia College]]\\'s Austin Campus, [[The Art Institute of Austin]], Southern Careers Institute of Austin, Austin Conservatory and branch campuses of [[Case Western Reserve University]] and [[Park University]].\\n\\nThe [[University of Texas System]] and [[Texas State University System]] are headquartered in downtown Austin.\\n\\n\\n\\nApproximately half of the city by area is served by the [[Austin Independent School District]]. This district includes notable schools such as the magnet [[Liberal Arts and Science Academy High School of Austin, Texas]] (LASA), which, by test scores, has consistently been within the top thirty high schools in the nation, as well as [[The Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders]]. The remaining portion of Austin is served by adjoining school districts, including [[Round Rock Independent School District|Round Rock ISD]], [[Pflugerville Independent School District|Pflugerville ISD]], [[Leander Independent School District|Leander ISD]], [[Manor Independent School District|Manor ISD]], [[Del Valle Independent School District|Del Valle ISD]], [[Lake Travis Independent School District|Lake Travis ISD]], [[Hays Consolidated Independent School District|Hays ISD]], and [[Eanes Independent School District|Eanes]] [[Independent school district|ISD]]. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe Austin metropolitan area is also served by 27 charter school districts and over 100 private schools.  Austin has a large network of private and alternative education institutions for children in PreK–12th grade exists. Austin is also home to several child developmental institutions.\\n\\n\\n\\nAustin\\'s main daily newspaper is the \\'\\'[[Austin American-Statesman]]\\'\\'. \\'\\'[[The Austin Chronicle]]\\'\\' is Austin\\'s [[alternative weekly]], while \\'\\'[[The Daily Texan]]\\'\\' is the student newspaper of the [[University of Texas at Austin]]. Austin\\'s business newspaper is the weekly \\'\\'[[Austin Business Journal]]\\'\\'. \\'\\'The Austin Monitor\\'\\' is an online outlet that specializes in insider reporting on City Hall, Travis County Commissioners Court, [[Austin Independent School District|AISD]], and other related local civics beats. The \\'\\'Monitor\\'\\' is backed by the nonprofit Capital of Texas Media Foundation. Austin also has numerous smaller special interest or sub-regional newspapers such as the \\'\\'[[Oak Hill Gazette]]\\'\\', \\'\\'Westlake Picayune\\'\\', \\'\\'Hill Country News\\'\\', \\'\\'Round Rock Leader\\'\\', \\'\\'NOKOA\\'\\', and \\'\\'The Villager\\'\\' among others. \\'\\'[[Texas Monthly]]\\'\\', a major regional magazine, is also headquartered in Austin. The \\'\\'[[Texas Observer]]\\'\\', a muckraking biweekly political magazine, has been based in Austin for over five decades. The weekly \\'\\'[[Community Impact Newspaper]]\\'\\' published by John Garrett, former publisher of the \\'\\'[[Austin Business Journal]]\\'\\' has five regional editions and is delivered to every house and business within certain ZIP codes and all of the news is specific to those ZIP codes. Another statewide publication based in Austin is \\'\\'[[The Texas Tribune]]\\'\\', an on-line publication focused on Texas politics. The \\'\\'Tribune\\'\\' is \"user-supported\" through donations, a business model similar to public radio. The editor is [[Evan Smith (journalist)|Evan Smith]], former editor of \\'\\'Texas Monthly\\'\\'. Smith co-founded the \\'\\'Texas Tribune\\'\\', a nonprofit, non-partisan public media organization, with Austin venture capitalist John Thornton and veteran journalist Ross Ramsey. \\n\\nCommercial radio stations include [[KASE-FM]] ([[Country music|country]]), [[KVET (AM)|KVET]] (sports), [[KVET-FM]] (country), [[KKMJ-FM]] ([[adult contemporary]]), [[KLBJ (AM)|KLBJ]] (talk), [[KLBJ-FM]] ([[classic rock]]), [[KJFK (AM)|KJFK]] (variety hits), [[KFMK]] (contemporary Christian), [[KOKE-FM]] ([[progressive country]]) and [[KPEZ]] ([[rhythmic contemporary]]).

[[KOOP (FM)]] is a volunteer-run radio station with more than 60 locally produced programs. [[KVRX]] is the student-run college radio station of the University of Texas at Austin with a focus on local and non-mainstream music and community programming. Other listener-supported stations include [[KAZI]] ([[urban contemporary]]), and [[KMFA]] ([[Classical music|classical]]).\\n\\nNetwork television stations (affiliations in parentheses) include [[KTBC (TV)|KTBC]] (Fox [[Owned-and-operated station|O&O]]), [[KVUE]] (ABC), [[KXAN]] (NBC), [[KEYE-TV]] (CBS), [[KLRU]] (PBS), [[KNVA]] (The CW), [[KBVO (TV)|KBVO]] (MyNetworkTV), and [[KAKW]] (Univision [[Owned-and-operated station|O&O]]). KLRU produces several award-winning locally produced programs such as \\'\\'[[Austin City Limits]]\\'\\'. Despite Austin\\'s explosive growth, it is only a medium-sized market (currently 38th) because the suburban and rural areas are not much larger than the city proper. Additionally, the proximity of San Antonio truncates the potential market area.\\n\\nAlex Jones, journalist, radio show host and filmmaker, produces his talk show \\'\\'[[The Alex Jones Show]]\\'\\' in Austin which broadcasts nationally on more than 60 AM and FM radio stations in the United States, [[WWCR]] Radio shortwave and [[XM Radio]]: Channel 166. \\n\\n\\nAustin has two types of relationships with other cities, [[Sister city|sister]] and friendship.\\n\\n\\n[[File:AustinSaltilloSisterAustinTX.JPG|thumb|right|Sister city monument in Austin commemorating the relationship with [[Saltillo]]]]\\nAustin\\'s sister cities are: \\n\\n*[[australia|🇦🇺]] [[City of Adelaide|Adelaide]], Australia (1983)\\n*[[france|🇫🇷]] [[Angers]], [[Pays de la Loire]], France (2011)\\n*[[turkey|🇹🇷]] [[Antalya]], [[Antalya Province]], Turkey (2009)\\n*[[south korea|🇰🇷]] [[Gwangmyeong]], [[Gyeonggi-do]], South Korea (2001)\\n* [[London Borough of Hackney|Hackney]], [[London, England]], United Kingdom (2014)\\n*[[germany|🇩🇪]] [[Koblenz]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], Germany (1991)\\n*[[peru|🇵🇪]] [[Lima]], Peru (1981)\\n*[[lesotho|🇱🇸]] [[Maseru]], Lesotho (1978)\\n*[[japan|🇯🇵]] [[Ōita (city)|Ōita]], [[Ōita Prefecture|Ōita]], Japan (1990)\\n* [[Orlu, Imo|Orlu]], [[South East (Nigeria)|South East]], Nigeria (2000)\\n*[[india|🇮🇳]] [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]], India (2018)\\n*[[mexico|🇲🇽]] [[Saltillo]], [[Coahuila]], Mexico (1968)\\n*[[taiwan|🇹🇼]] [[Taichung]], Taiwan (1986)\\n*[[china|🇨🇳]] [[Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture|Xishuangbanna]], [[Yunnan]], China (1997)\\n\\nThe cities of [[Belo Horizonte]], Brazil and [[Elche]], Spain were formerly sister cities, but after an Austin City Council vote in 1991, their statuses were deactivated. \\n\\n\\nCovenants between two city leaders: \\n*[[cambodia|🇰🇭]] [[Siem Reap]], Cambodia (2011)\\n*[[mexico|🇲🇽]] [[Tehuacán]], Mexico (2019)\\n*[[france|🇫🇷]] [[Villefranche-sur-Mer]], France (2010)\\n\\n\\n\\n* [[List of companies based in Austin, Texas]]\\n* [[List of people from Austin, Texas]]\\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Travis County, Texas]]\\n* [[Music of Austin, Texas|Music in Austin]]\\n* [[List of Austin neighborhoods|Neighborhoods in Austin]]\\n\\n\\n\\n* \\n* \\n* [[Lawrence Wright|Wright, Lawrence]]. \"[https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/02/13/the-astonishing-transformation-of-austin The Astonishing Transformation of Austin, Texas]\". \\'\\'The New Yorker\\'\\', February 6, 2023.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n* [http://austintexas.gov/ AustinTexas.gov] - official city website\\n* [http://austinchamber.com/ Austin Chamber of Commerce]\\n* [http://texashistory.unt.edu/browse/contributor/ASPL/ Historic photographs from the Austin History Center], hosted by the [http://texashistory.unt.edu/ Portal to Texas History]\\n* \\n* \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
