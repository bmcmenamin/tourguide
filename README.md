# tourguide

This repo contains was inspired by my love of reading [historical markers](https://www.hmdb.org/) and the power of Wikipedia graph traversals like [Six-degrees of Wikipedia](https://github.com/jwngr/sdow).

# TODO
* update ingestion to drop 'cited works' section
  * or: include links grouped by section for flexible querying
* limit topic-expansion to smaller neighboring nodes?
* prevent places from being bridge nodes?
* how to prevent the 'austin problem'
